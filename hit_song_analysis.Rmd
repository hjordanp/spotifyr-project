  select(c('name','artist'))

  # All song names to lowercase to match spotify (since the filter function below is case sensistive)

  # Get only first artist

We are looping over the dataframe of top songs (top_songs_list) to get the information and the features of each song.
```{r}

# Create an empty dataframe to append the information of each track
track_features <- NULL



for (i in 1:nrow(top_songs_list))     {
  
  # Search function on spotify allows you to search a song, artist or playlist. We will search each song to retreive      their track_id (we will need it to get all features from the track).
  
  search <- spotifyr::search_spotify(as.character(top_songs_list$name[i]), 'track')
  
  colnames(search) <- paste0('track_', colnames(search))
  
  # All track names to lowercase to match the top_songs_list data 
  search$track_name <- tolower(search$track_name)

  
  # Search is still a dataframe with too much information. We want only one track (row) of that dataframe. The one        that matches with our top_songs_list. 
  
  # We will need to know who is the main artist of each track in the search dataframe.
  search <- search %>%
  tidyr::unnest(cols = 'track_artists') %>%
  dplyr::group_by(track_id) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(row_number = 1:n(),
          artists = name) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::filter(row_number == 1)

  # Now let's filter the search dataframe with the artist and the track name we have on our top_songs_list dataframe.
  filtered_search <- search%>%
  dplyr::filter(name == top_songs_list$artist1[i])%>%
  dplyr::filter(track_name == top_songs_list$name[i])
  
  # We have noticed that we get three different cases when filtering:
  # - we get only one song (that is the best case scenario)
  # - we get more than one song (we will need to select only the one that matches the top_songs_list)
  # - we don't get any song (worst case scenario)
  
  # To solve this problem, we will use the column 'track_popularity'. We assume that since the songs are the top x        songs most listened, they will be the most popular.
  # To solve the case where we have more than one, we will order them by populatiry (descending) and get the top 1.
  # To solve the case where we have no songs, we will go back to the search dataframe and from all the songs, get the     one with more popularity.
  
  if(nrow(filtered_search) == 0){
    filtered_search <- search%>%
      filter(rank(desc(track_popularity))<=1)
}else{
    filtered_search <- filtered_search%>%
      filter(rank(desc(track_popularity))<=1)
}
  

  # Now that we have the track_id from the song we want, let's get its features!
  audio <- spotifyr::get_track_audio_features(filtered_search$track_id)
  
  # To know which song is which, let's add the name column of top_songs_list. To know if this name matches with the       filtered_search name, we will add this column too. 
  audio$track_name <- top_songs_list$name[i]
  audio$spotify_track_name <- filtered_search$track_name
  
  # Now that we have the features of the song, we just need to append the audio dataframe to the one we created before     the for loop.
  track_features <- dplyr::bind_rows(track_features, audio)
  
}
```
